        <h1>Red</h1>
		<p>Red means to stop, or feel alarm</p>
		
		<h1>Orange</h1>
		<p>Orange is generally used to warn of road construction, so I'd say orange is a color that signals alertness</p>
		
		<h1>Yellow</h1>
		<p>Yellow also means alert, but a softer shade can suggest sunshine and brightness.</p>
		
		<h1>Green</h1>
		<p>Green suggests nature, and in traffic, is a signal to proceed.</p>
		
		<h1>Blue</h1>
		<p>I think blue mainly suggests water and sky. The various shades can evoke anything from midnight darkness to a day at the beach.</p>
		
		<h1>Purple</h1>
		<p>Purple suggests royalty.</p>
		
		<h1>White</h1>
		<p>White suggests a blank slate. </p>
		
		<h1>Gray</h1>
		<p>I think gray shouldn't evoke much more than a neutral background shade. </p>
		
		<h1>Black</h1>
		<p>I think the right combination of black and white can suggest simplicity.</p>
		
		<h1>Brown</h1>
		<p>Brown can be combined with other colors to evoke Earth tones.</p>
		
		<h1>Pink</h1>
		<p>Pink can be used to evoke feelings of fun.</p>
